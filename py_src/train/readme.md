# Notes

These files are basically (blind) copy paste of the training scripts from [Brando's original Beyond Scale project](https://github.com/brando90/beyond-scale-language-data-diversity/tree/main/src/training).
If something doesn't work open a discussion or even better see that original script and try debugging it ;)
